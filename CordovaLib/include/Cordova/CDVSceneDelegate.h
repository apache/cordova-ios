/**
 UI scene delegate class with some additional Cordova-specific behavior.

 The scene delegate object manages your appâ€™s window behaviors. Your app should
 include its own SceneDelegate class which is a subclass of `CDVSceneDelegate`.

 `CDVSceneDelegate` provides an extension point for Cordova plugins to safely
 add behavior to the app by building on system events such as URL handling and
 scene/window management.

 See `UIWindowSceneDelegate` for more details about app delegates.

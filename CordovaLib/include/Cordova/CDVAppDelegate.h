/**
 App delegate class with some additional Cordova-specific behavior.

 The app delegate object manages your appâ€™s shared behaviors. Your app should
 include its own AppDelegate class which is a subclass of `CDVAppDelegate`.

 `CDVAppDelegate` provides an extension point for Cordova plugins to safely add
 behavior to the app by building on system events such as URL handling, push
 notification registration, and deep linking.

 See `UIApplicationDelegate` for more details about app delegates.

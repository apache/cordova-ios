## Thanks for installing Cordova!

## Plugins

* Plugins **MUST** add their plugin mapping to under their app's **config.xml** &lt;plugins&gt; key, see your plugin's README e.g.
    
        <plugin name="MyPluginName" value="MyPluginClass" />
        
* Plugins **MUST** add any external hosts they connect to to the white-list in config.xml - see the [**Domain Whitelist Guide**](http://docs.cordova.io/en/edge/guide_whitelist_index.md.html#Domain%20Whitelist%20Guide), e.g.

        <access origin="www.apache.org" />
        
* A plugin's Objective-C code **MUST** be added to the project properly in a "group" (**YELLOW** folder), if you incorrectly added it as a folder reference it would be a blue folder (just delete the reference, and re-add)

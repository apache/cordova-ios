- phonegap.js is minified using the YUI compressor, and also renamed to phonegap.{ver}.min.js where {ver} is the version number of PhoneGapLib from the VERSION file
- the PhoneGap template is changed as well, at build time it will replace any references to 'src="phonegap.js"' to the new versioned js file (and copy the new phonegap.{ver}.min.js file). This replacement will look in all files in the 'www' folder.
- note that with the new PhoneGapLib phonegap.{ver}.min.js renaming, existing PhoneGap templates must copy the new "Copy PhoneGap Javascript" post-build script from the new template (in Xcode, under Targets/[ProjectName])

- Removed keys from PhoneGap.plist (AutoRotate, StartOrientation, RotateOrientation).
- To support orientation in your app: edit/add the UISupportedInterfaceOrientations (iPhone) or UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad (iPad) key into your app's [appname]-Info.plist, with an array of strings that show what orientation your app supports. The supported values are: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft, UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight. 
- The first value in the array is the orientation that your app starts in. If you have more than one value in the array, it will autorotate (to the other supported orientations).
